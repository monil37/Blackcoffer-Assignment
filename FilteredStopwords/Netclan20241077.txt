Advanced for Road Cam Threat Detection Client Background Client: A leading tech firm the Middle Industry Type: Security Services: Security services Organization Size: 100+ The Problem Detect the threat level of accidents between a Pedestrian and a Car. Our Solution Use Deeplearning Computer vision and logic to detect the threat level as defined by the Client. Solution Architecture Linux 22.04 Deliverables Program which detects the threat level. Pretrained model. Tools used Yolov7 DEEPSORT Opencv Language/techniques used Python Models used Yolov7 Skills used Programming Computer Vision Deep learning What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution Integration of Object tracking algorithm with Object detection algorithm. Writing of logic to detect the threat level. How the Technical Challenges were Solved The technical challenge was sorted by testing, experimenting and later on finding and modifying already existing repository to use as a baseline for our code for integration.
