Optimize the data scraper program to easily accommodate files and solve OOM errors Client Background Client: A leading tech firm Industry Type: IT Services Services: SAAS services, Marketing services, Business consultant Organization Size: 100+ Project Description Building a data warehouse that houses projects and tenders data all over the world that is to be collected official government websites, multilateral banks, state and local government agencies, data aggregating websites, etc. Our Solution We had tried multiple solutions to prevent the program running out of memory. We used python pandas techniques to control the use of memory which worked for some files and did not work for others. Provided solutions using vaex ,dask module and datatables. Project Deliverables Desired changes to the code and committing them to github. Tools used Vscode Python Github Language/techniques used Chunking dask Dataframe vaex datatable python. Skills used Python Time complexity What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution System specs requirement was the issue during this project because the RAM available was too less and got used up quickly. How the Technical Challenges were Solved Team viewer to use remote desktop which had higher specs would be sufficient enough to solve the problem. Business Impact Provided various techniques to solve memory issues. Suggested parallel programming to decrease the execution time by 12% making getting the tender data at a much faster rate.
