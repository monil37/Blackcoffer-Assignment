After implementing Executor codes, I created a Flow to connect every executor and deployed it successfully. Deliverables Successfully delivered executable deployed models Tools used AI, VSCode, HuggingFace Language/techniques used Python Models used Whisper, Stable Diffusion, GPT3, Codex, YOLO, CoquiAI, PDF Segmentor Skills used Python, Model APIs Databases used JinaAI What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution There were minute challenges, such as deployment issues and Execution issues How the Technical Challenges were Solved I resolved the issues effectively after hours of understanding the concept because JinaAI is a growing technology that does not have forums to solve errors and issues.
