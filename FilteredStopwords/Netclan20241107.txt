ML-based web application that detects the correctness of text a given video Client Background Client: A Design & Media firm the USA Industry Type: Marketing Services: Consulting, Software, Marketing Solutions Organization Size: 100+ Project Objective Create a python web application that detects the text and checks the spelling of written text the videos and prints the count of wrong spelling the end Project Description Developing a dockerized Django web application for detecting the text and checking the spelling of written text the video and printing the count of wrong spelling the end and deploying the application on google Our Solution We have created a python web application with Django framework when user uploads the video the application run keras-ocr model on each of the video and keep the count of the wrong words at the end it provides the video with the bounding around the words. For correct words it creates bounding and for wrong words it creates bounding and also it provides the summation of count of wrong words. Project Deliverables Deployed dockerized web application on google which generate video with bounding around texts Tools used Docker Redis Server Django Celery Nginx Opencv NLTK Moviepy Language/techniques used Python Html CSS JavaScript Models used We have used keras-ocr model for detecting the text form the video and creating the bounding around the words Skills used Natural language processing, Machine learning, Image processing, Web development, Python programming Databases used Django Sqlite3, Redis Server Web Servers used Google What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution Running model on each of the video Show progress bar for the progress of the work How the Technical Challenges were Solved For running the model on each of the video we have used celery it runs the model the backend of the application We have used celery backend progressrecorder and updated it every time when model has detected the text the of the video Project Snapshots Project website url http://34.68.134.64/
