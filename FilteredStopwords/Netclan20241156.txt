Marbles Stimulation using python Client Background Client: A leading consulting firm the USA Industry Type: IT Consulting Services: Consultanting Organization Size: 100+ Project Objective For all 4 cases, use a random number generator that give you between 1 & a [1,000,000]. Whatever generator you use, make sure to adjust the that they are between 1 & 1,000,000 distributed randomly. For all tasks, we have 5 colors, for example Task 1, when the random number selected is between 1 & 5857 choose a color that is easily visible [I have called it Br. Clr. 1], for between 5858 & 8678 choose another color [Br. Clr. 2], for between 8679 & 11500 choose B (Blue), for between 11501 & 50,000 choose R (Red), and 50,000 choose G (Green). Simulate these 4 Task scenarios and represent them a Table (1000 x 32) and collect statistics at the end. Replicate the simulation exercises for each Task with 3 different initial seed numbers. Likewise for 16 other Tasks. Our Solution Task involves creating 20 excel files running a Python Script Jupyter Notebook which contains certain integer ranges indicating certain values and some other criteria the Random number [1 to 1 million]. There are 20 Different tasks which have different conditions based on which need to form. Simulate these 20 Tasks and represent them a Table (1000 x 32) and collect statistics at the end. Replicating the simulation exercises for each Task with 3 different initial seed numbers. Then using the Find and Replace tab of excel to make it the correct format with proper color. Data Representation particular format and formatting colors, Text based on condition passed within excel. Project Deliverables Excel File Tools used JupyterNB Sublime Text MS Excel Language/techniques used Python Models used No Software model is being Used to Solve this Project Skills used Python programming MS Excel Formatting Databases used No database were used stored complete data MS Excel Web Servers used No servers were used for this project What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution Formatting Excel Files How the Technical Challenges were Solved Formatting Excel Files Discovered a lot of Shortcuts Available within Excel to with Data Representation particular format and learned about formatting colors, Text based on condition passed within excel. Replication and Selecting Rows and Columns with shortcuts and simplest possible, transposing selected data and more. Project Snapshots Figure 1: Output File for Task 12 stimulation 3 total there were 16 conditional tasks all of them had 3 stimulation which needed to be performed.
