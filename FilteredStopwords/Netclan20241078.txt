Advanced for Pedestrian Crossing Safety Client Background Client: A leading tech firm the Middle Industry Type: Security Services: Security services Organization Size: 100+ The Problem Traffic Signals are inefficient because even if there are no cars or no pedestrians on the road it works on a timer and stops the traffic or pedestrian unnecessarily. Our Solution We provide a Computer vision-logic to Manipulate the traffic signal to work such that it turns only when x number of pedestrians are waiting to the signal. Solution Architecture Yolov7 pose estimation Opencv Deliverables The program Detects Pedestrians and Gives alerts to traffic Signals to turn or stay Green. Yolov7 pose model weights Tools used Yolov7 Opencv Language/techniques used Python Computer Vision Models used Yolov7 Pose Estimation Skills used Programming Computer Vision Deep Learning What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution There was no existing solution and we had to create the logic scratch. How the Technical Challenges were Solved Researching Computer Vision. Learning Techniques and Experimentation.
