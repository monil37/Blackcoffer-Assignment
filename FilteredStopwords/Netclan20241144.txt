Splitting of Songs into its Vocals and Instrumental Client Background Client: A leading Entertainment firm the USA Industry Type: Entertainment Services: Organization Size: 100+ Project Objective The objective of this project is to split a into its vocals and instrumental. Project Description The project aims at taking a Hindi language as input and separating the vocals(lyrics) the instrumental of the song. Save both the vocals and instrumental files separately as output. Our Solution I have used Python programming language for this project. The use of a Python library called Spleeter developed by Deezer has been made to achieve our goal. Spleeter is Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written Python and uses Tensorflow. It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides already trained state of the model for performing various flavor of separation : Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation ( 2 stems ) Vocals / drums / / other separation ( 4 stems ) Vocals / drums / / piano / other separation ( 5 stems ) 2 stems and 4 stems models have performance on the musdb dataset. Spleeter is also very as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU. Project Deliverables Python tool that takes Hindi as input and gives two audio files as output: vocals file and instrumental file. Language/techniques used Python Models used 2 Stems model Skills used Advanced Python programming Project Snapshots
