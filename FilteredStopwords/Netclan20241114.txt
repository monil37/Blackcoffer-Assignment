Incident Duration Prediction â€“ Infrastructure and Estate Client Background Client: A leading research institution the middle Industry Type: Research Services: R&D Organization Size: 1000+ Project Objective To complete a Research Paper draft by training various Machine Learning models which can predict the Incident Duration based on various parameters given the dataset and summarising the results. Project Description Given a set of researches, need to analyse and compare various machine learning and deep learning models to predict the Incident Duration for the given dataset. The dataset contained durations as well as durations. Build models for each set of durations, compare and get the out of all. Our Solution Here, we had to predict the traffic incident duration with some machine learning tools and techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR and Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models were run on Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model was run on R studio, all the three with the same dataset and then we had compared these models based on their (mean absolute error). Initially, we had done a preliminary analysis of the collected incident duration data, to collect the statistical characteristics of all the variables used our research. Project Deliverables Python Script for each model. Documentation for Research Work. Tools used Python Interpreter Language/techniques used Language Used: Python Libraries Used: pandas, sklearn, numpy, keras, Models used XGBRegressor SVR SGDRegressor Sequential DecisionTreeRegressor Skills used Programming, Statistical Analysis Project Snapshots
