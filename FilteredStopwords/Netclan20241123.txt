MetaBridges API Decentraland Integration â€“ AR, VR Client Background Client: A leading tech firm the USA Industry Type: IT Services: Consulting, Software, Blockchain, Metaverse Organization Size: 20+ Project Objective To integrate with Metaverse environments with the help of EC2, S3 bucket and the Decentraland SDK. Project Description Move 3D model files EC2 instance to S3 bucked using aws-sdk. Our Solution Configure s3 bucket aws account, create user for s3 bucket api keys, and api secret. Put the api key, aapi secret, bucket name and bucket region environment variable to use them app. Install aws-sdk to implement s3 bucket. Create a function to send file nodejs server to s3 bucket. Project Deliverables Aws ec2 instance credentials, s3 bucket credentials. Code used the project Tools used vs code editor, git terminal, google chrome web browser.
