Impact of news, media, and press on innovation, startups, and investments Client Background Client: A leading research institution the Industry Type: Research, R&D Services: R&D Organization Size: 1000+ Project Objective Make data for predictive modelling. Making Google Data Studio dashboard. Project Description Phase – 1: this project first of all we have to clean the data as the data was very noisy, we have to filter out only the needed columns of the data. Phase – 2: Finding co-relation between the pitchbook data and the other output files. Phase – 3: Making dashboard Google Data Studio for the project. Our Solution We used pandas and numpy to clean the data and make useful for it to be used predictive modelling. We have found the co-relation between the tempa msa pitchbook data and the output files like textual file, ai_ml_tm file etc. We have made the dashboard using the Google Data Studio. Project Deliverables We have provided a excel file consisting of clean data and the Google Data Studio report. Tools used Python, Google Data Studio, Google Chrome Language/techniques used Python Programming Models used Waterfall model used this project. Skills used Data cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Data Visualisation are used this project. Databases used We have used the traditional file systems as database storage. What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution Cleaning the data was the challenge faced while executing the project. The data has a lot of noise. It was difficult to find which data was useful and which data is not useful this project. Secondly the co relation between the output files and pitchbook data. There was nothing common between both the datasets. was difficult to find co-relation between them. How the Technical Challenges were Solved We used pandas dataframe to clean the data and make it for predictive modelling and used the Google Data studio to find insights between the different datasets.
